  pc: `This is my PC. My preferred domain is Full stack development. I also dedicate my time to learning Competitive Programming, mostly in C++, although I do practice in Java now and then.
  Here are my <a href="https://github.com/kdjayyyy" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/kdjayyyy" target="_blank">Codeforces</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/kd_26" target="_blank">Codechef</a> and my <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/kdjayyyy/" target="_blank">Leetcode</a> profiles!`,

  'degree': `This space here is reserved for my B.Tech degree. Although I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Petroleum Engineering, my interests lie in the domain of coding and tech!`,

  'sofa-table': `That's my sofa. I like to relax here, brainstorm and look out for relevant information in the tech world from sources across the web.`,

  tv: `That's my TV. I mostly stick to tech youtubers for staying updated with the tech world and also for gaining some insights into problem solving. Some of my favourites are :

  bed: `This is my bed, where I recharge my neural networks. A place where the algorithms of creativity run wild amidst the cozy confines of my bed. Ideas, like threads of code, weave through the fabric of my consciousness. When the muse of innovation strikes, I must hastily transcribe the binary of inspiration into tangible form, lest the RAM of my mind becomes overwhelmed with processing.`,

  resume: `This is my desk and on it is my resume. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gzVLqvN55X-D5wg_dOb1FlhpdNf0IlcD/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Check it out?</a>

  projects: `Info about this portfolio : It's made with the Kaboom.js library which is used for making games in JavaScript. The overall backbone has been built upon Vite.js.
  Text is rendered with HTML/CSS. So the textbox you're currently reading is not rendered within canvas. 
  Besides this project, I have also worked in a couple of hackathons that have further solidified my knowledge of the software engineering world. Check them out in my resume!`,

  library: `There are a lot of books on my shelf, mostly novels that intrigued me during my juvenile days. Besides that I stick to programming books (I mean, obviously!)`,
  
  exit: `If you wish to exit the portfolio, just close this tab!`,
